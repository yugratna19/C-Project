# Formula Encyclopedia

## Introduction
This project is intended to organize some of the basic formulas that are required in our first semester using C. This will enable students to focus on the actual question rather than wasting time searching for formulas. This will help boost productivity of students and also enable them to have a quick recap over all the formulas.
## Objective
* To develop an application that compiles most of the formulas
* To increase the efficiency of students in solving problems.
